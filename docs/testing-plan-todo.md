## ðŸ”„ In Progress / Testing Required

### Core Functionality Testing
- [ ] **Chat keyboard behavior** - Test on mobile device/emulator to verify input visibility
- [ ] **Authorization flow** - Verify current team fetching and storage on login
- [ ] **Profile enhancements** - Test detailed user information display
- [ ] **Team management** - Test owner member removal with confirmation dialogs
- [ ] **Delete confirmations** - Verify all delete operations use ConfirmationDialog component
- [ ] **Push notifications** - Test permission requests and local notifications

### Native Features
- [ ] **Native maps implementation** - react-native-maps polygons for mobile devices
- [ ] **Notification system integration** - Test push notifications for team events

### Code Quality & Performance
- [ ] **Component reusability** - Verify extracted components work across screens
- [ ] **Utility functions** - Test profileUtils.ts and teamUtils.ts functions
- [ ] **TypeScript compliance** - Ensure all new components have proper typing
- [ ] **Performance testing** - Verify no regressions in app performance

## ðŸ“‹ Remaining Tasks

### Priority 1: Final Testing & Polish
1. **Mobile device testing**
   - Test keyboard behavior in ChatScreen on actual devices
   - Verify push notification permissions and functionality
   - Test enhanced profile page display and interactions
   - Validate team member management features for owners

2. **Integration testing**
   - Test authorization flow with team fetching
   - Verify all confirmation dialogs work correctly
   - Test extracted utility functions across different screens
   - Validate code minimization doesn't break existing functionality

### Priority 2: Native Features
1. **Maps integration**
   - Implement react-native-maps polygons for mobile
   - Test territory visualization on native maps
   - Ensure web compatibility is maintained

2. **Advanced notifications**
   - Implement push notifications for team events
   - Test notification handling and user interactions
   - Integrate with backend notification system

### Priority 3: Performance & Quality
1. **Code optimization**
   - Further extract common patterns into reusable components
   - Optimize component rendering and state management
   - Ensure consistent TypeScript typing throughout

2. **Documentation updates**
   - Update all documentation files after each change
   - Maintain accurate feature status tracking
   - Document new utility functions and components
